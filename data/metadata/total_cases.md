**Notes**:    

1. The number of confirmed cases tested under pillar 1 (hospitals) and pillar 2 (commercial labs and home tests). Further information about the pillars of the Government's mass testing programme are available on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-testing-programmes/coronavirus-covid-19-scaling-up-our-testing-programmes" target="_blank">gov.uk</a>.        
2. The date of a confirmed case corresponds to the *specimen* date rather than the *reporting* date.         
3. There is a lag between the specimen date and the reporting date so recent data are likely to change. Public Health England <a href="https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/about" target="_blank">recommend</a> that only cases reported more than 5 days ago should be treated as 'complete'.    
4. The number of *confirmed* cases is likely to be much lower than the *total* number of cases because not all people who report symptoms of coronavirus are being tested.    
5. Confirmed cases include patients, key workers and their families.     
6. Confirmed cases for Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly are combined.      
7. The rate of cases is calculated by dividing the total number of cases by the mid-2022 estimate of the resident population of each local authority multiplied by 100,000.        
8. Similar local authorities are identified using <a href="https://www.cipfastats.net/resources/nearestneighbours" target="_blank">CIPFA's Nearest Neighbours Model</a>.
